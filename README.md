*Project Description*
This project is a basic keylogger built in Python using the pynput library. It captures and logs keystrokes to a text file in real-time, showcasing foundational concepts of keyboard event handling and file I/O in Python.

 ⚠️ Disclaimer: This is a minimal and educational version of a keylogger intended solely for learning, research, or ethical testing environments. Any unauthorized or malicious use is strictly discouraged and may be illegal under cybersecurity laws.

Features
Captures all keystrokes, including special keys (Enter, Space, etc.).

Logs keystrokes to a file named key_log.txt.

Stops gracefully when the Esc key is pressed.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.

The pynput library.

Installation Steps
bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone this repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd <project-directory>

# Install the pynput dependency
pip install pynput
Usage
To run the keylogger:

bash
Copy
Edit
python keylogger.py
The script will start logging keystrokes to key_log.txt.

Press the Esc key to terminate the logger safely.

Code Overview
on_press(key): Logs key presses (alphanumeric and special keys) to a file.

on_release(key): Monitors key release events and stops the logger when Esc is detected.

Listener: pynput.keyboard.Listener is used to monitor and manage key events.

Ethical Considerations
This project is intended strictly for ethical and educational use. Do not deploy or use this keylogger on systems or individuals without explicit consent. Unauthorized monitoring is illegal and unethical.

Future Enhancements
I plan to expand this project in future versions to explore:

Bypassing antivirus detection for research purposes and red teaming simulations.

Encrypting logs for enhanced security.

Sending logs via email (remote monitoring setups).

Adapting to different keyboard layouts and OS environments.

These enhancements will be implemented with strong ethical boundaries and intended only for authorized penetration testing, malware analysis training, or cybersecurity research environments.
